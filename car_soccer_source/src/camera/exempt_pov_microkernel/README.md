# Exempt Black-Box Zone (Exempt POV Microkernel Zone)

> **Immutable External Black-Box POV Camera Model**
> 
> This directory is the dedicated controlled black-box zone for the RocketSim POV camera microkernel.
> According to the system architectural contract, the POV Camera is an external solidified black-box microkernel with the following strict specifications:
> 
> 1. **Tampering Prohibited & Strong Hash Verification**:
>    - The canonical SHA-256 hash of the physical WASM binary `camera.wasm` is:
>      `b8adc96e73372d0f53346499fb150b576fb08deb0494d8f7f7e989d9daea0854`
>    - Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', buffer)`) strictly validates the byte stream at runtime during initial loading.
>    - If the hash mismatches or loading fails, a blocking fatal exception is immediately thrown:
>      `[FATAL] POV Camera Microkernel hash mismatch or missing! Tampering detected.`
> 
> 2. **Strict ABI & Linear Memory Contract**:
>    - Mandatory verification of the four exported symbols: `memory`, `getViewPtr`, `stepView`, and `resetView`.
>    - Strict validation that the pointer returned by `getViewPtr()` is 8-byte aligned and falls entirely within valid WASM linear memory bounds (accommodating 42 Float64 fields).
> 
> 3. **Zero Fallback Architecture**:
>    - All pure JavaScript simulations or heuristic fallbacks (such as legacy `stepFallbackView`) are completely eliminated.
>    - The RocketSim physics core (`core.wasm`) is strictly prohibited from falling back or substituting for the POV camera.
>    - If the microkernel is missing or corrupted, game startup terminates immediately during the first-frame preflight validation with a dedicated error overlay, preventing entry into the main game loop.
